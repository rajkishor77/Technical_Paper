# Core Concepts in JavaScript: An Easy-to-Understand Guide

## 1\. Data Types: The Building Blocks

JavaScript data types fall into two main groups: **Primitives** and **Objects**. Primitives hold a single, simple value, while Objects can hold collections of complex data.

### Primitive Data Types (Simple, Immutable Values)

These values can't be changed after they're created (they are **immutable**).

  * **`string`**: For any text (e.g., `"apple pie"`).
  * **`number`**: For both whole numbers and decimals (e.g., `100`, `3.14`).
  * **`bigint`**: For extremely large whole numbers that the regular `number` type can't safely handle.
  * **`boolean`**: For true/false values.
  * **`undefined`**: Means a variable has been declared but **not yet assigned a value**.
  * **`null`**: Means the variable has been intentionally set to hold **no value** (the developer explicitly cleared it).
  * **`symbol`**: Used to create unique identifiers, often for object properties.

### Non-Primitive Data Type (The Object)

  * **`object`**: The main complex type. This includes:
      * **Plain Objects**: Key-value pairs (`{ name: "Bob", age: 30 }`).
      * **Arrays**: Ordered lists (`[1, 2, 3]`).
      * **Functions**: Code that can be called and executed (which are also objects in JS\!).

-----

## 2\. Variable Declarations: `let`, `const`, and `var`

JavaScript gives us three keywords to declare variables, each with its own rules for where the variable is available (**scope**).

### 2.1. `const` (The Constant—Use First\!)

  * **Best For**: Values that should **never change**.
  * **Scope**: **Block-Scoped**. It's only available within the curly braces (`{}`) where it was defined.
  * **Rule**: You must assign a value when you declare it, and you **cannot re-assign** it later.
      * *Note*: For objects and arrays, you can change the contents (e.g., add an item to an array), but you can't point the variable to a *new* array or object.

### 2.2. `let` (The Flexible Variable—Use Second\!)

  * **Best For**: Values that you expect to **change** (e.g., counters, loop variables).
  * **Scope**: **Block-Scoped**.
  * **Rule**: You can assign it a new value (re-assign it) as many times as you want.

### 2.3. `var` (The Outdated Keyword—AVOID\!)

  * **Best For**: Nothing. Seriously, don't use it in new code.
  * **Scope**: **Function-Scoped** (or Global). This means a variable declared inside an `if` block or `for` loop is often visible *outside* that block, which leads to confusing and buggy code.

-----

## 3\. Why we must not use `var`

The main reasons to avoid `var` are its loose **function-scoping** and the way its declaration is automatically moved to the top of its scope (**hoisting**), leading to:

1.  **Scope Leaks**: A variable declared inside a small block of code (like an `if` statement) might accidentally become visible and usable outside that block.
2.  **Confusing Behavior**: It's too easy for a `var` variable in one place to unintentionally overwrite (or **shadow**) another variable with the same name elsewhere, making bugs hard to trace.

-----

## 4\. Why using global variables is bad

A **global variable** is visible and accessible everywhere in your program.

  * **Messy Conflicts**: When multiple parts of your code (or external libraries) use the same global variable name, they can accidentally overwrite each other, causing unpredictable bugs (**namespace collision**).
  * **Fragile Code**: If any function, anywhere, can change a global variable, it's impossible to tell where and when its value was changed. This makes debugging a nightmare.
  * **Poor Structure**: It ties unrelated parts of your program together, making the code harder to test and reuse (**low modularity**).

-----

## 5\. Truthy and falsy values

In JavaScript, any value can be treated as either `true` or `false` in a logical test (like an `if` statement). This process is called **type coercion**.

### Falsy Values

There are only six values that convert to `false`. Memorize them\!

1.  `false`
2.  `0` (the number zero)
3.  `""` or `''` (the empty string)
4.  `null`
5.  `undefined`
6.  `NaN` (Not a Number)

### Truthy Values

**Everything else** is **truthy**, meaning it converts to `true`.

  * Examples: `"0"`, `' '` (a string with a space), `[]` (empty array), `{}` (empty object), and any number other than 0.

-----

## 6\. Function hoisting

**Hoisting** is JavaScript's behavior of conceptually moving declarations to the top of the current scope during compilation.

  * **Function Declarations** (`function myFunc() {}`): The **entire function** is hoisted. You can call the function *before* you define it in the code.
  * **Function Expressions/Arrow Functions** (`const myFunc = () => {}`): Only the variable (`myFunc`) is hoisted (like `let` or `const`), but not the function definition itself. You **must** define it before you call it.

-----

## 7\. What happens when a function does not have a return statement

If you don't explicitly write `return someValue;`, the function automatically returns **`undefined`**.

-----

## 8\. Different ways of declaring a function

1.  **Function Declaration (Standard)**:
    ```javascript
    function calculateSum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    ```
2.  **Function Expression (Assigned to a Variable)**:
    ```javascript
    const calculateSum = function(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    };
    ```
3.  **Arrow Function (The Modern, Concise Way)**:
    ```javascript
    const calculateSum = (a, b) => a + b;
    ```

-----

## 9\. Pass by reference and pass by value

JavaScript's model for passing arguments is often called **Pass by Sharing** (a mix of the two).

  * **Primitives (`number`, `string`, `boolean`, etc.)**: Passed **by value**. A **copy of the value** is passed. Changing it inside the function **does not affect** the original variable.
  * **Objects/Arrays**: Passed as a **copy of the reference (memory address)**.
      * If you **mutate the object** (e.g., change a property or add an array item), the original object **is changed**.
      * If you **re-assign the parameter** to a *new* object (e.g., `arr = [1, 2]`), the original variable **is NOT affected** (you only changed the local copy of the reference).

-----

## 10\. Different types of for loops

### Standard `for` Loop (with numbers)

Used when you need to control the exact number of times you loop, or when working with array indices.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { /* ... */ }
```

### `for...in`

Iterates over the **keys (property names)** of an **object**.

  * *Caution*: **DO NOT use this for arrays** as it can include unexpected properties and keys are strings.

### `for...of`

Iterates over the **values** of an **iterable** (like Arrays, Strings, or Maps). This is the cleanest way to loop over array values.

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "blue"];
for (const color of colors) { /* color is "red", then "blue" */ }
```

### `forEach`

A built-in array **method**. It runs a function (a callback) for every item.

  * **Limitation**: It is a method, not a loop structure, and **cannot be stopped** using `break`.

-----

## 11\. Searching mdn (mozilla developer network)

MDN Web Docs is the best and most reliable resource for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS documentation. When you need to understand how a method works, its parameters, return values, browser compatibility, or see examples, your search should always start with "MDN [concept/method name]".

  * **Example Search**: "MDN Array map", "MDN String slice", "MDN try catch".

-----

## 12\. Popular array utility methods

These are Higher-Order Functions (HOFs) that take a callback function and perform an operation on the array, usually returning a new array or a single value.

  * **`map(callback)`**: **Transforms** every item and returns a **new array** of the same length. (e.g., `[1, 2].map(n => n * 2)` $\rightarrow$ `[2, 4]`).
  * **`filter(callback)`**: **Selects** items that meet a condition and returns a **new array** (often smaller). (e.g., `[1, 2, 3].filter(n => n > 1)` $\rightarrow$ `[2, 3]`).
  * **`reduce(callback, initialValue)`**: **Aggregates** the array into a **single value** (e.g., a sum, a combined object).
  * **`find(callback)`**: Returns the **first element** that satisfies the condition.
  * **`forEach(callback)`**: Executes a function for each element (used for side effects, returns `undefined`).

-----

## 13\. Popular string utility methods (Strings are immutable)

  * **`trim()`**: Removes whitespace from both ends.
  * **`toLowerCase()` / `toUpperCase()`**: Converts case.
  * **`includes(substring)`**: Checks if the string contains a specific substring (returns `true`/`false`).
  * **`slice(start, end)`**: Extracts a piece of the string and returns a new string.
  * **`split(separator)`**: Breaks a string into an array of substrings.

-----

## 14\. Popular object utility methods

  * **`Object.keys(obj)`**: Returns an array of the object's property **names** (keys).
  * **`Object.values(obj)`**: Returns an array of the object's property **values**.
  * **`Object.entries(obj)`**: Returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs.
  * **`Object.assign(target, ...sources)`**: Copies properties from source object(s) to a target object (often used for shallow copying).

-----

## 15\. When to use `forEach`, when to use array utility methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

  * **Use `forEach`**: When you need to perform an **action (a side effect)** for each item and **don't need a return value**. *Example: Logging each item, saving each item to an external API.*
  * **Use `map`, `filter`, `reduce`**: When you need to **transform data** and return a **new value** (new array, or single aggregate value). These are preferred for data manipulation because they are immutable and chained easily.

-----

## 16\. Immutable and mutable methods

  * **Immutable Methods**: **Do not change the original data structure**. They return a brand new one. (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `slice`, `concat`, `...` spread operator). **(Preferred)**
  * **Mutable Methods**: **Change the original data structure in place** (a **side effect**). (e.g., `push`, `pop`, `splice`, `sort`, `reverse`). **(Use with Caution)**

-----

## 17\. Error handling (`try catch`)

The `try...catch` statement handles runtime errors so your program doesn't crash.

  * The **`try` block** contains the code that might fail.
  * The **`catch` block** receives the error object if a failure occurs in the `try` block, allowing you to handle it gracefully.

<!-- end list -->

```javascript
try {
  // Risky code
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error here
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

-----

## 18\. Throwing errors

The **`throw` statement** is used to create a custom error and immediately stop the function execution, passing control to the nearest `catch` block.

### 19\. Difference between `throw new Error("Error message here")` and `throw "Error message here"`

  * **`throw new Error(...)` (Preferred\! )**: Creates a proper **Error object**. This object automatically includes the **stack trace**, which lists the file and function calls leading to the error. This is **vital for debugging**.
  * **`throw "Error message here"` (Avoid\! )**: Throws a simple string. It **loses the stack trace**, making it extremely hard to figure out *where* the error came from.

-----

## 20\. Reading error messages and tracing issues from the stack trace when errors happen - practice this daily for 2 weeks with different examples. this is very important

This is the most critical skill for a developer.

1.  **Identify the Error Type**: Look at the start (e.g., `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`). This tells you the nature of the bug.
2.  **Read the Message**: The text describes *what* went wrong ("is not a function," "cannot read property 'x' of undefined").
3.  **Trace the Stack**: The stack trace is a list of function calls. Find the **topmost line** that references **your file name** and **line number**. That is the origin of the bug. Use this path to trace the logic flow that led to the error.

-----

## 21\. Importance of catch block

The `catch` block is essential because it:

1.  **Prevents Program Crash**: It intercepts the error, preventing it from halting the entire application's execution.
2.  **Handles Errors Gracefully**: It allows you to log the error, display a user-friendly message, or provide a safe fallback mechanism.

-----

## 22\. Spread operator (`...`)

The spread operator unpacks elements from arrays or properties from objects. It's the best way to copy/combine data **immutably**.

  * **Array Creation**: `const newArr = [...oldArr, 4, 5];` (Adds elements)
  * **Object Creation**: `const newObj = { ...oldObj, newProp: 'value' };` (Adds/updates properties)

-----

## 23\. Template literals

Use **backticks** (`` ` ``) instead of quotes. They let you:

1.  **Interpolate**: Embed variables directly using **`${variableName}`**.
2.  **Multi-line**: Write strings that span multiple lines easily.

<!-- end list -->

```javascript
const name = "Luna";
const message = `Welcome, ${name}.
We're glad you're here.`;
```

-----

## 24\. Default parameters

Allows you to set a fallback value for an argument if the caller doesn't provide one (or passes `undefined`).

```javascript
function greet(name = "Guest") {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
greet(); // "Hello, Guest"
```

-----

## 25\. Destructuring

A shortcut to unpack values from objects or arrays into distinct variables.

  * **Object Destructuring**: `const { name, age } = person;`
  * **Array Destructuring**: `const [first, second] = colors;`

-----

## 26\. Closures

A **closure** is when an inner function "remembers" and can access the variables from its outer function's scope, **even after** the outer function has finished executing.

  * **Why it matters**: It allows you to create functions that maintain a private state (like a private counter).

<!-- end list -->

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; // 'count' is closed over
  return function() { return ++count; };
}
const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // 1
```

-----

## 27\. Difference between arrow functions and regular functions

The main difference is about how they handle the keyword **`this`**.

| Feature | Regular Functions (`function`) | Arrow Functions (`=>`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`this` Binding** | Gets its own dynamic `this` based on how it's called. | Does **not** get its own `this`. **Inherits `this`** from the surrounding (lexical) scope. |

-----

## 28\. Difference between `===` and `==`

  * **`==` (Loose Equality)**: Checks for value equality **after forcing type conversion**. (e.g., `0 == false` is `true`). **AVOID\!**
  * **`===` (Strict Equality)**: Checks for equality **without** any type conversion. Both the **value AND the type must be the same**. (e.g., `0 === false` is `false`). **ALWAYS USE\!**

-----

## 29\. Why using `value === undefined` is better than using `!value`

  * `!value` checks if the value is **falsy** (`0`, `""`, `null`, or `undefined`). This is too broad and can hide bugs if you pass in a falsy value you didn't mean to exclude.
  * `value === undefined` checks specifically and precisely if the value is *exactly* **`undefined`**. This is explicit and safer.

-----

## 30\. Array utility methods chaining

Because `map`, `filter`, and `slice` all return a **new array**, you can call them one after another (chaining) for efficient, declarative, and highly readable data manipulation.

```javascript
const result = data
  .filter(n => n % 2 === 0) // Filter returns a new array
  .map(n => n * 10)         // Map returns a new array
  .reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0); // Final result
```

-----

## 31\. Difference between `null` and `undefined`

| Term | Meaning | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`undefined`** | The variable exists, but no value has been assigned yet. | `undefined` |
| **`null`** | Represents the intentional absence of an object value. | `object` (a historical mistake in JS) |

-----

## 32\. Importing and exporting modules using `require` and `module.exports`

This is the standard **CommonJS** module system, primarily used in Node.js environments.

  * **Exporting**:
    ```javascript
    // module.js
    module.exports = {
      add: (a, b) => a + b
    };
    ```
  * **Importing**:
    ```javascript
    // main.js
    const math = require('./module');
    math.add(2, 3);
    ```

-----

## 33\. The different methods of console such as `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.info` and so on

Use these methods for debugging and monitoring execution flow.

  * **`console.log(...)`**: General purpose output.
  * **`console.error(...)`**: Output for logging errors. Often displayed in red and includes the stack trace.
  * **`console.warn(...)`**: Output for non-critical warnings (often yellow).
  * **`console.info(...)`**: Output for general information (often styled differently than `log`).
  * **`console.table(data)`**: Displays complex data (like arrays of objects) in a clear, formatted table.

-----

## 34\. All the best practices mentioned on the LMS - indendation, variable naming, loop variable naming and all the others

| Best Practice | Rule | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Indentation** | Use **2 or 4 spaces** consistently. | |
| **Variable Naming** | Use **`camelCase`** for variables, functions, and methods. | `calculateTotal`, `firstName` |
| **Constant Naming** | Use **`UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`** for constant values. | `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `API_KEY` |
| **Loop Variables** | Use `i`, `j` for simple indices; use descriptive names otherwise. | `for (let userIndex of users)` |
| **Comparison** | **Always** use **`===`** (strict equality). | `if (value === 10)` |
| **Declaration** | Use `const` first, then `let` if re-assignment is needed. **Never use `var`**. | |

-----

## 35\. Passing functions to other functions and invoking them on demand

This is known as using **Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)**. You pass a function (called a **callback**) as an argument to another function, which can then execute that callback when a specific event occurs (on demand).

```javascript
function runOperation(a, b, callback) {
  // Invoking the callback on demand
  return callback(a, b);
}
// Pass an anonymous function (callback)
runOperation(5, 3, (x, y) => x + y); // Returns 8
```

-----

## 36\. Differences between named functions and anonymous functions

  * **Named Functions** (`function greet() {}`): Have a specific name. Better for recursion and **debugging**, as the name appears clearly in the stack trace.
  * **Anonymous Functions** (`function() {}` or `() => {}`): Have no name. Primarily used when passed as a **callback** to another function or immediately executed.

-----

## 37\. Variable number of arguments passed to functions

The **rest parameter** syntax (`...variableName`) allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments and collects them into a real **array**.

```javascript
function average(...nums) {
  // 'nums' is an array: [10, 20, 30]
  const sum = nums.reduce((total, n) => total + n, 0);
  return sum / nums.length;
}
average(10, 20, 30);
```
